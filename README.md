As a developer, here is what I did to create my website

My motivation with this project was a layout of a website I will be building.  
Right now the basic elements are there, it just needs to be polished.
It's a little rough around the edges. 

I built this portion of the website as a way of demonstrating my skills so far. This is my way of advertising
my ability to build a website. 

I learned that while I may not have the best tastes when it comes to designing a website, I know how to
make a website using the technical aspects.

Some of the challenges that I faced were the looks of the website,
the technical aspects are almost done, but not quite.

I have faced some issues setting up the links to my contact info, I am just hoping that the links do work outside of my machine.
